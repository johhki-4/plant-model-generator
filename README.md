# Plant model generator

## Dependencies for the trace generation
Follow all the steps given by the Factory of the Future Repository on github:
https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/afof/tracing-products/-/tree/master/

When you get to:
- Simulation in Visual Components
  - Requirements
    - Setting up dependencies,

do the same steps for the `AFOF_2.py` file given in this repository.

You also need to go into the file and on line 30 specify the desired location.

## Usage of the simulation in Visual Components
When you get to:
- Simulation in Visual Components
  - Usage,

open the `PoductionTracing2020.vcmx` file given in **this** repository instead.

## Model Generator
Once the simulations work and you can generate trace files it is time to get the model generator and generate a NuSMV model file from the traces.
